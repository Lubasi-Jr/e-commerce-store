Stylas is a fictional e-commerce platform that I developed as part of my third-year Information Systems E-commerce Project. The platform offers a carefully curated selection of authentic African vinyl records, traditional musical instruments, and collectible album cover posters. Its primary objective is to preserve and promote African musical heritage by providing customers with a tangible and culturally rich experience that goes beyond digital music consumption. 

This business concept targets music collectors, culture enthusiasts, and gift buyers, offering products that help users reconnect with African history, culture, and artistry. Stylas is designed to appeal to individuals who are looking for meaningful, nostalgic, and educational items that reflect African identity and creativity. Through this project, I aimed to apply core e-commerce principles in developing a culturally inspired and user-focused digital retail solution.
